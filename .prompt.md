Task: Keep chat member list in sync with updated LoginUserInfo after profile updates.

Plan:
1) Add a RoomStore action (e.g., syncLoginMemberInfo) to update the current user's ChatMember entry across all loaded rooms (and pendingRoomInfoMap if applicable), refreshing nickname/avatar fields and keeping online status intact.
2) Invoke the new action when loginUserInfo is refreshed (inside userStore.syncUserState after loginUserInfo is set), so profile updates immediately reflect in the member list UI.
3) Optionally call the same action after fetchRoomMembers/updateRoomInfo to ensure server-returned lists are normalized with the latest loginUserInfo.
4) Verify no unsafe type assertions are introduced; keep updates guarded by existence checks and reuse existing avatar cache helpers.
