Debugging LogAspect Compile Error

Step 1: Analyze the Issue
- The user is getting `AfterReturning cannot be resolved to a type` in `LogAspect.java`.
- This annotation belongs to the AspectJ library (`org.aspectj`).
- Checking `pom.xml`, the `spring-boot-starter-aop` dependency is missing.
- This dependency is required for Spring AOP support (including `@Aspect`, `@AfterReturning`, etc.).

Step 2: Execution Plan
1. Modify `backend/EZChat-app/pom.xml`:
   - Add `spring-boot-starter-aop` dependency in the `<dependencies>` section.

Step 3: Verification
- The error should disappear once the dependency is resolved.
