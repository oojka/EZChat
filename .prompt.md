# Execution Plan: Delete Legacy request.ts Proxy

The logic has been successfully modularized into the `src/utils/request/` directory. The current `src/utils/request.ts` only serves as a re-export and is no longer needed as module resolution will prioritize the directory's `index.ts`.

## Proposed Changes

1. **Cleanup**:
   - Delete `src/utils/request.ts`.

## Verification
- Ensure that the application still compiles and makes API requests correctly (module resolution test).
