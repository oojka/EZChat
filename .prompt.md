Task: Add room password configure/disable in RoomSettingsDialog using PasswordConfig, with backend update API.

Analysis & Suggestions
- "Group password" maps to `chats.chat_password_hash`; disabling should set it to NULL. Keep `join_enabled` unchanged (CreateChatDialog already always sends joinEnable=1), unless you want join toggling too.
- Reuse PasswordConfig UI and mirror CreateChatDialog validation (password required when enabled, confirm match). Consider extracting validation into a small composable to avoid duplication.
- Backend needs owner-only API to update password (set/clear) and should log changes; validate confirm match and handle "disable" cleanly.

Execution Plan
1) Backend: add request/VO for updating room password; add `ChatService` method + `ChatController` endpoint (owner-only). Update `ChatMapper`/XML with password update query. Implement validation, logging, and clear hash when disabled.
2) Frontend: add API wrapper + types and runtime guards. Create a small composable for password form state/validation mirroring `useCreateChat`.
3) RoomSettingsDialog: embed `PasswordConfig` section, use `el-form` with rules, bind to composable, add submit button and loading state.
4) UX: on disable, clear password fields and submit to backend; refresh current room info if needed. Update i18n keys for new labels and errors if missing.
